    This dashboard performs **two-sided threshold monitoring** for FX volatility, 
    both per single currency and for synthetic cross-currency pairs.
    
    **Steps & Methods**  
    1. **Data Preprocessing**  
       - Load CSV, parse dates, sort, dedupe.  
       - Annualize volatility (×√252) and interpolate missing values.  
    2. **Manual Group Assignment**  
       - Low (≤0.07), Medium (0.07–0.5), High (0.5–0.6), Very High (>0.6).  
       - “Very High” upper bound capped at observed max.  
    3. **Dynamic Threshold Methods**  
       - **Rolling Window** (60-day 5th & 95th percentile)  
       - **GARCH(1,1) + EVT** (fit by AIC; tail at 5% & 95%)  
       - **Isolation Forest** (tunable contamination & n_estimators)  
       - **One-Class SVM** (tunable nu & gamma)  
       - **Regime Change** (mean ±2·std over 30 days)  
    4. **Consensus Taming**  
       - Collect all methods + manual bounds.  
       - Compute **median** of upper & lower thresholds → final “tamed” limits.  
    5. **Cross-Currency Monitoring**  
       - Build synthetic volatility of pair = average(vol_base, vol_quote).  
       - Apply same two-sided methods + manual & consensus.  
    6. **Visualization & Download**  
       - Interactive Plotly charts (upper/lower bands).  
       - Downloadable CSV summaries per view.
