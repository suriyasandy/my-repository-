This dashboard performs **two-sided threshold monitoring** for FX volatility, 
both per single currency and synthetic cross-currency pairs.

### Steps & Methods:
1. **Data Preprocessing**
    - Load CSV, parse dates, sort, deduplicate.
    - Interpolate missing values if needed.
    - **Important:**  
      Volatility scaling adjustment depends on whether the input volatility is already annualized.
2. **Volatility Annualization**
    - If volatility is purely daily realized (from OHLC returns),  
      ‚ûî **Multiply** by ‚àö252 to convert it to annualized basis.  
    - If volatility is already reported as annualized daily (per day),  
      ‚ûî **No multiplication needed** ‚Äî use as-is.
3. **Manual Group Assignment**
    - Based on Annualized Volatility:
        - Low (‚â§0.07)
        - Medium (0.07‚Äì0.5)
        - High (0.5‚Äì0.6)
        - Very High (>0.6)
    - For 'Very High', upper bound is capped at actual observed max volatility.
4. **Threshold Models**
    - Rolling Window (5th/95th percentile)
    - GARCH-EVT (Extreme Value Theory on residuals)
    - Isolation Forest (unsupervised anomaly detection)
    - One-Class SVM (boundary detection)
    - Regime Detection (mean ¬± 2¬∑std over time)
5. **Cross-Currency Monitoring**
    - Synthetic Volatility = Average(Base, Quote).
    - Apply same threshold methods to synthetic series.
6. **Consensus Threshold Calculation**
    - Collect thresholds from all methods + manual.
    - Compute median ("tamed" consensus thresholds).
7. **Visualization**
    - Plot raw volatility, thresholds, manual bounds, consensus bands.
    - Allow download of all comparison tables.

### ‚ÑπÔ∏è Important: Confirm Volatility Scaling with Data Team
Before proceeding, **please confirm** with your source (OPS Team or Vendor):

- **Is the volatility purely daily realized (needs multiplication by ‚àö252)?**
- **Or is it already annualized per day (no adjustment needed)?**

‚úÖ If volatility is raw realized daily ‚ûî Multiply by ‚àö252  
‚úÖ If volatility is already annualized ‚ûî No multiplication

**Failing to adjust correctly can misclassify currencies into wrong risk groups!**
